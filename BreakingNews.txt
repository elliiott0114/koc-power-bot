Missing gems?  
Often aetherstone counts are wrong as addressed <a href="http://community.kabam.com/forums/showthread.php?155344-Bug-in-function-to-removes-an-item-%28please-pass-on-to-the-Devs%29">here</a>

However that is not a huge issue until you factor in that kabam doesn't ask for permission to take your gems when you don't have enough aetherstone. permission is assumed.

Tell kabam you want them to ask your permission first!!
