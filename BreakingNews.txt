Fey Altars are somehow auto sacrificing troops as they come out of the training queues in some cases.  
We suggest contacting support  if you have expirienced this. <a href="https://kabam.secure.force.com/PKB/pkb_contactUs?game=Kingdoms_of_Camelot&lang=en_US&l=en_US">kabam support</a>
There have been no additions to the bot/tools script to use the fey altar.  
As far as we can tell, this is a kabam issue.
