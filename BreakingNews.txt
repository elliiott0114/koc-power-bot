help the enemy toggled my throne room!

It's not a practice of the enemy toggling your throne room to whatever they want.  
It's that when you clicked the button the kabam server rejected your request to toggle to throne room set whatever and still showed you that it has toggled.  
To verify this you can go to web developer /web console in firefox.  filter for dispatch53 and right click on the console to check log request and response bodies.  
Now toggle your throne room back and forth and eventually you will get "{"ok":false,"error_code":0}" as the response but it will still show that your throne room has changed.  

In response to this issue we scripters have made you a throne room toggle in bot under throne subtab throne which is still very much in development.
