Bug Reports and Feature Requests!
=================================

Since the demise of Userscripts no-one seems to know where to report bugs and feature requests, well worry no longer.
The GoogleCode project pages have an "Issues" tab, where you can submit bug reports and requests.

Game News!
==========

Kabam are still milking the "I gotta have it to keep up" Cash Cow. Master Tokens 18's are now available, and 19's will not be too long after. Woo hoo.. :/

Doves still break when you build a city past lvl 5. Never mind, after 4 years Kabam FINALLY fixed the rally point march size bug (That Tools had already fixed years ago) so there's hope yet...


Thanks for continuing to use KoCScripters PowerBot and PowerTools.
