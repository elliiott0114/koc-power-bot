REGARDING TOOLS PLAYER SEARCH....

To clarify...

This is not a tools issue. This is a kabam problem. If you click your leaderboard at the bottom of the game, and then 'view' a player, nothing happens. 

This is NOT domain related. For some it works on one domain, and for others on exactly the same domain it does not work.

It does not seem to be browser/tools/system/anything else related, IT IS A KABAM ERROR.

It will work for some and not for others.

We have made kabam aware.
