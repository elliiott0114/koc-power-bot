GoogleCode Projects
===================

Google have announced that they are to close GoogleCode completely in January 2016. Prior to that, they are making all existing GoogleCode projects READ-ONLY from August 2015.

Bearing this in mind, GoogleCode will no longer be updated with new versions of the Koc Scripts.

The KocScripters Googlecode SVN projects are essentially no more.

I will continue to update my GreasyFork versions only for the forseeable future.

Cheers,
Barb.
