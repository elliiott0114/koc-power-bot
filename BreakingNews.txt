xray vision has been released into public domain.  We've been asking kabam for over 2 months to fix this exploit that allows detection of who owns the mists without scouting.

We were very alarmed when we found the code in kocmon which we put even more pressure on kabam to fix.  

How the code works

we bookmark a misted city

we request info from kabam about our bookmark

it returns the true identity of the owner.

Please file a report with the link to kabam above!
