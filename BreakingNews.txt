Also, starting to think kabam is right and bugs don't matter.  Didn't even break 1000 signatures!
Which means less than 1% of the people playing koc actually care about the bug.

We've waited for kabam to fix the misted city exploit long enough.  Time for you to take action!  Time to boycott gems until they fix this!
