#KoC Power Bot

This script is designed for use in conjunction with KoC Power Tools (https://github.com/tomchapin/koc-power-tools) and provides many useful automated functions for the Kingdoms of Camelot Facebook game! 

*KoC Power Bot* is a collaborative effort which began between George Jetson, Don Davici, Tom Chapin, and other members of the community. It is currently being actively maintained by the "KoC Scripters" group of programmers, which consists of more than 20 people.

##NEWS

We created a new userscripts.org account for publishing ongoing updates to KoC Power Bot. A number of us will be sharing access to this account, so updates at the new location are not limited to just one person. This new account on userscripts.org is called "kocscripters", and the new KoC Power Bot page can be found [http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/101052 here].

Feel free to use the forums at userscripts to discuss KOC Power BOT, but issues (bug reports, enhancement requests) should be made [http://code.google.com/p/koc-power-bot/issues/list HERE] on the Google Code site, so they can be properly tracked.
