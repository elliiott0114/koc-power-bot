#KoC Power Bot

This script is designed for use in conjunction with KoC Power Tools (https://github.com/tomchapin/koc-power-tools) and provides many useful automated functions for the Kingdoms of Camelot Facebook game! 

*KoC Power Bot* is a collaborative effort which began between George Jetson, Don Davici, Tom Chapin, and other members of the community. It is currently being actively maintained by the "KoC Scripters" group of programmers, which consists of more than 20 people.
